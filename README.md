# Pong

Implementation of the game 'Pong', done as a project at NYU. 
Finished on April 5, 2023

## How to play

When the program runs, the game automatically begins. 

Move your cursor up and down to hit the ball against the wall until you lose it! 
Score depends on how long you survived. There will be special changes to the game if you reach a specific time.
